# BolderNotify

This programm is born in the despair of corona. Climbing is my passion but every boulder gym in my city is almost closed. All except one where you can book a spot in an random time span of one hour during the day. Since I don't want to depend on luck and laszy, I wrote a programm to notify me, when I can book a spot.

You need a Twilio Account for this programm to work and authentificate your phone number (one phone number is free) and add the Account SID and Token to the programm.

Then just execute with "python bolder.py".
